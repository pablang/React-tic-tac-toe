# React Tic-Tac-Toe

I thought I'd recreate my original vanillaJS tic-tac-toe game using React. I started off just making a basic game using the React tutorial and then expanded on it by adding my own components and refactoring the check winner function and added extra features.

### Features
- Players are able to choose avatars before startiing the game
- The chosen play avatars are used to mark the board
- Avatars are animated to roll in from either side of the screen depending on who placed the mark
- The winning row is animated to 'jelly wobble'
- The game is able to keep track of how many rounds are played
- A button can reset the board

## Tech used
- React JS
- animations from Animista
- Assets created in Sketch

## Still to do
- Winner tally of each player
- Add more styling
- Fix onClick bugs on avatars
